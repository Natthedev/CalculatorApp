# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app

![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my completed front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Made (recreated in code) by Natalee Redding. 

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 

Your users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
- - I left a note about the bonus in the JS.

#### Reflection: 
- What I Learned:
  I liked this project because of the challenge it presented, but I was not expecting it to be this challenging. I learned a few things. I learned how to use multiple files to create the theme switch, I learned so much about JavaScript and got in-depth practice with event listeners and logic, and lastly, I learned the importance of formatting in JS. It was a challenge. I wanted to practice my CSS gridding and I am confident in that skill now. I also wanted to get more in-depth practice with JS and this for sure fulfilled that need. I wanted to do the bonus, but the localstorage function didn't seem to work. I consulted my friend to see if I had any mistakes, but he could not find any. He asked chatGPT and not even the AI could figure out why it wasn't working. So, I gave up on that but I did learn a ton of information on how to make it work and how to use cookies. I know my next project will need it so I will learn it then.

- My process:
  I started with making the whole design for theme 1. I started with the CSS this time and then did the HTML. Once I was satisfied I worked on the javascript, and by then it was day 3 and 3am. I wondered why it wasn't switching themes until I realized I didn't have themes 2 or 3 coded out. So, I went back and coded them out. The first issue arose here, I had everything in my HTML file. No separate files, and for the life of me I couldn't get it to work. I asked chatGPT for advice and it suggested based on another person's repo to separate it all. I decided to try it and what do ya know, that actually worked and it was easier to track it all. I took 9 days to do this project. Finally, when I had gotten everything done, the themes switched, and I could use the calculator I just needed to use either GitHub pages or Vercel. I went with pages first but it wasn't running the themes nor the JS. So, I tried Vercal and luckily that worked. I like Vercal's UI better too, which I will be using for ALL of my future projects now.

##### Tools and Resources
-- What I Used:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Figma] (https://www.figma.com) - For Layout, brainstorming, and styling
- [URLencoder] (https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/)- for .svg images to code elements using background-image

--Resources:
  - [W3Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/) - While I know it doesn't explain everything, it's an extremely great resource to learn from and use for debugging issues. This resource is how I learned HTML and CSS in a month and now I am super comfortable with it.
- [URLencoder] (https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/)- for .svg images to code elements using background-image. It's a great tool to decode SVG files.
- [Figma] (https://www.figma.com) - For Layout, brainstorming, and styling. Figma is magical, and ever-expanding as a resource. If you think you know figma, I promise you don't. I love using Figma to just draw things out or to actually create working prototype wireframes. I love Figjam for brainstorming, collaboration, problem-solving, branding formats, and everything in between. Figma has changed my life. I thought Whiteboard and Unreal Engine were cool until I was introduced to Figma. I have now used it for years and I still find cool features to this day.
- [MozillaMDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) This website is like W3, but it explains every single term used. It's a great resource to learn from and have fun while learning to code.
- [ChatGPT] (https://chat.openai.com/) - It's THE AI to consult for issues and advice. It's like having an older friend who is really good at things like code, advice, and explaining things. Don't use it to cheat though. You can NOT learn if you have chatGPT do everything for you.
